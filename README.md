# python_final_project
This was my first huge project, which I 
used to code at the end of my favorite 
course. The game is unfinished, but close 
to it, it has very few bugs and the 
gameplay is still small, but in order to 
increase it and make it more diverse, you 
no longer need to invent anything new, but 
simply repeat some already written code.
